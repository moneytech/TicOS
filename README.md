# TicOS
TicOS is an Intel x86 operating system designed to run TIC-80 programs.

Since TIC-80 is limited, the OS doesn't need that much features, it only supports ext2 on a IDE disk.

Basically, it requires ~8MB of RAM and an **IDE** hard disk. It's goal is to fit on a 1.44MB single-sided floppy.
It's so small that Lua 5.2 is bigger than the whole kernel!
